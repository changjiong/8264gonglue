This script, written in Python, is designed to search for and download PDF files from a specific website. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **Imports and Dependencies**:
   - It uses libraries like `requests` for HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing, and `googlesearch` for Google search queries.
   - It handles missing dependencies by prompting the user to install them.

2. **PDF Downloader (`download_pdf`)**:
   - Downloads PDFs from a given URL using a session.
   - Validates and ensures the destination folder exists.
   - Determines the filename from the URL or HTTP headers. If no valid name is found, it generates one based on a timestamp.
   - Saves the file in chunks to handle large downloads efficiently.
   - Handles SSL verification issues and provides detailed error messages for failures.

3. **Google Search and Parse (`search_and_download_pdfs`)**:
   - Searches Google for PDF files on a specific domain (e.g., `columbiasports.cn`) using the `googlesearch` library.
   - Filters results to only include direct links to PDFs from the target domain.
   - Downloads the identified PDFs using the `download_pdf` function.

4. **Main Program**:
   - Defines a Google search query to find PDFs on the website `columbiasports.cn`.
   - Sets the folder for saving downloaded PDFs and controls the number of search results.
   - Executes the search and download process, summarizing the results at the end.
